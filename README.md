# Island Survival
An alpha version of the Island Survival scenario for the game Glest.

The scenario is still in development. Its story is not yet complete by any means.

Credits to:

-The Glest team for their development of the awesome Glest game

-[titiger](https://github.com/titiger), who took the initative to develop such a tediously long scenario and developed almost all of the units in this scenario

-Andy, for forking the game into ZetaGlest and including it in the built-in scenarios

-MathuSum Mut, who did a complete revision of the code, fixed bugs and extended the story. It is yet to be finished
